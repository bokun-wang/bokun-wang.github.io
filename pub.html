	   <font face = "Verdana" size = "2.0vw" color = #5D6D7E> We study the discriminative probabilistic modeling problem on a continuous domain for (multimodal) self-supervised representation learning. To address the challenge of computing the integral in the partition function for each anchor data, we leverage the multiple importance sampling (MIS) technique for robust Monte Carlo integration, which can recover InfoNCE-based contrastive loss as a special case. Within this probabilistic modeling framework, we conduct generalization error analysis to reveal the limitation of current InfoNCE-based contrastive loss for self-supervised representation learning and derive insights for developing better approaches by reducing the error of Monte Carlo integration. To this end, we propose a novel non-parametric method for approximating the sum of conditional densities required by MIS through convex optimization, yielding a new contrastive objective for self-supervised representation learning. Moreover, we design an efficient algorithm for solving the proposed objective. We empirically compare our algorithm to representative baselines on the contrastive image-language pretraining task. Experimental results on the CC3M and CC12M datasets demonstrate the superior overall performance of our algorithm.</font>           </dd>

	   <font face = "Verdana" size = "2" color = #5D6D7E> Recent work has shown that 8-bit floating point (FP8) can be used for efficiently training neural networks with reduced computational overhead compared to training in FP32/FP16. In this work, we investigate the use of FP8 training in a federated learning context. This brings not only the usual benefits of FP8 which are desirable for on-device training at the edge, but also reduces client-server communication costs due to significant weight compression. We present a novel method for combining FP8 client training while maintaining a global FP32 server model and provide convergence analysis. Experiments with various machine learning models and datasets show that our method consistently yields communication reductions of at least 2.9x across a variety of tasks and models compared to an FP32 baseline. </font>           </dd>

	   <font face = "Verdana" size = "2" color = #5D6D7E> While revolutionizing social networks, recommendation systems, and online web services, graph neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Recent state-of-the-art adversarial attacks rely on gradient-based meta-learning to selectively perturb a single edge with the highest attack score until they reach the budget constraint. While effective in identifying vulnerable links, these methods are plagued by high computational costs. By leveraging continuous relaxation and parameterization of the graph structure, we propose a novel attack method -- DGA to efficiently generate effective attacks and meanwhile eliminate the need for costly retraining. Compared to the state-of-the-art, DGA achieves nearly equivalent attack performance with 6 times less training time and 11 times smaller GPU memory footprint on different benchmark datasets. Additionally, we provide extensive experimental analyses of the transferability of DGA among different graph models, as well as its robustness against widely-used defense mechanisms. </font>           </dd>

	   <font face = "Verdana" size = "2" color = #5D6D7E> This paper considers a novel application of deep AUC maximization (DAM) for multi-instance learning (MIL), in which a single class label is assigned to a bag of instances (e.g., multiple 2D slices of a CT scan for a patient). We address a neglected yet non-negligible computational challenge of MIL in the context of DAM, i.e., bag size is too large to be loaded into {GPU} memory for backpropagation, which is required by the standard pooling methods of MIL. To tackle this challenge, we propose variance-reduced stochastic pooling methods in the spirit of stochastic optimization by formulating the loss function over the pooled prediction as a multi-level compositional function. By synthesizing techniques from stochastic compositional optimization and non-convex min-max optimization, we propose a unified and provable muli-instance DAM (MIDAM) algorithm with stochastic smoothed-max pooling or stochastic attention-based pooling, which only samples a few instances for each bag to compute a stochastic gradient estimator and to update the model parameter. We establish a similar convergence rate of the proposed MIDAM algorithm as the state-of-the-art DAM algorithms. Our extensive experiments on conventional MIL datasets and medical datasets demonstrate the superiority of our MIDAM algorithm. </font>           </dd>

	   <font face = "Verdana" size = "2" color = #5D6D7E>In recent years, model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) has become a popular research area. However, the stochastic optimization of MAML is still underdeveloped. Existing MAML algorithms rely on the “episode” idea by sampling a few tasks and data points to update the meta-model at each iteration. Nonetheless, these algorithms either fail to guarantee convergence with a constant mini-batch size or require processing a large number of tasks at every iteration, which is unsuitable for continual learning or cross-device federated learning where only a small number of tasks are available per iteration or per round. To address these issues, this paper proposes memory-based stochastic algorithms for MAML that converge with vanishing error. The proposed algorithms require sampling a constant number of tasks and data samples per iteration, making them suitable for the continual learning scenario. Moreover, we introduce a communication-efficient memory-based MAML algorithm for personalized federated learning in cross-device (with client sampling) and cross-silo (without client sampling) settings. Our theoretical analysis improves the optimization theory for MAML, and our empirical results corroborate our theoretical findings.</font>          </dd>

	   <font face = "Verdana" size = "2" color = #5D6D7E>Distributed machine learning has become an indispensable tool for training large supervised machine learning models. To address the high communication costs of distributed training, which is further exacerbated by the fact that modern highly performing models are typically overparameterized, a large body of work has been devoted in recent years to the design of various compression strategies, such as sparsification and quantization, and optimization algorithms capable of using them. Recently, Safaryan et al (2021) pioneered a dramatically different compression design approach: they first use the local training data to form local smoothness matrices, and then propose to design a compressor capable of exploiting the smoothness information contained therein. While this novel approach leads to substantial savings in communication, it is limited to sparsification as it crucially depends on the linearity of the compression operator. In this work, we resolve this problem by extending their smoothness-aware compression strategy to arbitrary unbiased compression operators, which also includes sparsification. Specializing our results to quantization, we observe significant savings in communication complexity compared to standard quantization. In particular, we show theoretically that block quantization with n blocks outperforms single block quantization, leading to a reduction in communication complexity by an O(n) factor, where n is the number of nodes in the distributed system. Finally, we provide extensive numerical evidence that our smoothness-aware quantization strategies outperform existing quantization schemes as well the aforementioned smoothness-aware sparsification strategies with respect to all relevant success measures: the number of iterations, the total amount of bits communicated, and wall-clock time.</font>          </dd>

	   <font face = "Verdana" size = "2" color = #5D6D7E> This paper studies stochastic optimization for a sum of compositional functions, where the inner-level function of each summand is coupled with the corresponding summation index. We refer to this family of problems as finite-sum coupled compositional optimization (FCCO). It has broad applications in machine learning for optimizing non-convex or convex compositional measures/objectives such as average precision (AP), p-norm push, listwise ranking losses, neighborhood component analysis (NCA), deep survival analysis, deep latent variable models, etc., which deserves finer analysis. Yet, existing algorithms and analyses are restricted in one or other aspects. The contribution of this paper is to provide a comprehensive convergence analysis of a simple stochastic algorithm for both non-convex and convex objectives. Our key result is the improved oracle complexity with the parallel speed-up by using the moving-average based estimator with mini-batching. Our theoretical analysis also exhibits new insights for improving the practical implementation by sampling the batches of equal size for the outer and inner levels. Numerical experiments on AP maximization, NCA, and p-norm push corroborate some aspects of the theory.</font>           </dd>

	   <font face = "Verdana" size = "2" color = #5D6D7E>In this paper, we propose systematic and efficient gradient-based methods for both one-way and two-way partial AUC (pAUC) maximization that are applicable to deep learning. We propose new formulations of pAUC surrogate objectives by using the distributionally robust optimization (DRO) to define the loss for each individual positive data. We consider two formulations of DRO, one of which is based on conditional-value-at-risk (CVaR) that yields a non-smooth but exact estimator for pAUC, and another one is based on a KL divergence regularized DRO that yields an inexact but smooth (soft) estimator for pAUC. For both one-way and two-way pAUC maximization, we propose two algorithms and prove their convergence for optimizing their two formulations, respectively. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms for pAUC maximization for deep learning on various datasets.</font>          </dd>

	   <font face = "Verdana" size = "2" color = #5D6D7E>In this paper, we investigate the problem of stochastic multi-level compositional optimization, where the objective function is a composition of multiple smooth but possibly non-convex functions. Existing methods for solving this problem either suffer from sub-optimal sample complexities or need a huge batch size. To address this limitation, we propose a Stochastic Multi-level Variance Reduction method (SMVR), which achieves the optimal sample complexity of O(1/ϵ^3) to find an ϵ-stationary point for non-convex objectives. Furthermore, when the objective function satisfies the convexity or Polyak-Łojasiewicz (PL) condition, we propose a stage-wise variant of SMVR and improve the sample complexity to O(1/ϵ^2) for convex functions or O(1/(μϵ)) for non-convex functions satisfying the μ-PL condition. The latter result implies the same complexity for μ-strongly convex functions. To make use of adaptive learning rates, we also develop Adaptive SMVR, which achieves the same optimal complexities but converges faster in practice. All our complexities match the lower bounds not only in terms of ϵ but also in terms of μ (for PL or strongly convex functions), without using a large batch size in each iteration.</font>          </dd>

	   <font face = "Verdana" size = "2" color = #5D6D7E>Riemannian optimization has drawn a lot of attention due to its wide applications in practice. Riemannian stochastic first-order algorithms have been studied in the literature to solve large-scale machine learning problems over Riemannian manifolds. However, most of the existing Riemannian stochastic algorithms require the objective function to be differentiable, and they do not apply to the case where the objective function is nonsmooth. In this paper, we present two Riemannian stochastic proximal gradient methods for minimizing nonsmooth function over the Stiefel manifold. The two methods, named R-ProxSGD and R-ProxSPB, are generalizations of proximal SGD and proximal SpiderBoost in Euclidean setting to the Riemannian setting. Analysis on the incremental first-order oracle (IFO) complexity of the proposed algorithms is provided. Specifically, the R-ProxSPB algorithm finds an ϵ-stationary point with O(ϵ^{−3}) IFOs in the online case, and O(n+\sqrt{n}ϵ^{−2}) IFOs in the finite-sum case with n being the number of summands in the objective. Experimental results on online sparse PCA and robust low-rank matrix completion show that our proposed methods significantly outperform the existing methods that use Riemannian subgradient information.</font>          </dd>

This is achieved by multiplying floating-point vectors with a number known to every device and then rounding to integers. In contrast to the prior work on integer compression for SwitchML by Sapio et al. (2021), our IntSGD method is provably convergent and computationally cheaper as it estimates the scaling of vectors adaptively. Our theory shows that the iteration complexity of IntSGD matches that of SGD up to constant factors for both convex and non-convex, smooth and non-smooth functions, with and without overparameterization. Moreover, our algorithm can also be tailored for the popular all-reduce primitive and shows promising empirical performance.</font>          </dd>

In this work, we consider a more general and practical setting where there can be many protected groups.
